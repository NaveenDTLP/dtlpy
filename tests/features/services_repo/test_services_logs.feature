    Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
        Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
        And There is a project by the name of "services_log"
        And I create a dataset with a random name
        And There is a package (pushed from "services/item") by the name of "services-log"

    @services.delete
    @packages.delete
    Scenario: Log
        When I create a service
            |service_name=services-log|package=services-log|revision=None|config=None|runtime=None|
        Then I receive a Service entity
        And I upload an item by the name of "test_item.jpg"
        And I run a service execute for the item
        And Log "THIS LOG LINE SHOULD BE IN LOGS" is in service.log()
