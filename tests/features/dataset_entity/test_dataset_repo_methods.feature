Feature: Dataset Entity repo functions

    Background: Initiate Platform Interface
        Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set to development
        And There is a project by the name of "dataset_repo_methods"
        And I create a dataset by the name of "Dataset"

    Scenario: Download Annotations
        Given Labels in file: "labels.json" are uploaded to test Dataset
        And Item in path "0000000162.jpg" is uploaded to "Dataset"
        And Item is annotated with annotations in file: "0162_annotations.json"
        And There is no folder by the name of "json" in assets folder
        When I download dataset entity annotations to assets
        Then I get a folder named "json" in assets folder
        And Annotations downloaded equal to the annotations uploaded

    # Scenario: Download dataset with items
    #     Given Item in path "0000000162.png" is uploaded to "Dataset"
    #     And Labels in file: "labels.json" are uploaded to test Dataset
    #     And Item is annotated with annotations in file: "0162_annotations.json"
    #     And There are no folder or files in folder "downloaded_dataset"
    #     When I download dataset entity to "downloaded_dataset"
    #     Then Dataset downloaded to "downloaded_dataset" is equal to dataset in "downloaded_dataset-should_be"
    #     And There is no "log" file in folder "downloaded_dataset"

    Scenario: Delete dataset
        When I delete a dataset entity
        Then There are no datasets

    Scenario: Finally
        Given Clean up
