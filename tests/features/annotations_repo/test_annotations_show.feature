Feature: Annotations repository show method testing

    Background: Initiate Platform Interface
        Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set to development
        And There is a project by the name of "annotations_show"
        And I create a dataset by the name of "Dataset"

    Scenario: Show mask
        Given Classes in file: "assets_split/annotations_show/classes_new.json" are uploaded to test Dataset
        And Dataset ontology has attributes "attr1" and "attr2"
        And Item in path "assets_split/annotations_show/0000000162.jpg" is uploaded to "Dataset"
        When Item is annotated with annotations in file: "assets_split/annotations_show/annotations_new.json"
        And I show items annotations with param "mask"
        Then I receive annotations mask and it is equal to mask in "new_mask_should_be.npy"

    Scenario: Show instance
        Given Classes in file: "assets_split/annotations_show/classes_new.json" are uploaded to test Dataset
        And Dataset ontology has attributes "attr1" and "attr2"
        And Item in path "assets_split/annotations_show/0000000162.jpg" is uploaded to "Dataset"
        When Item is annotated with annotations in file: "assets_split/annotations_show/annotations_new.json"
        And I show items annotations with param "instance"
        Then I receive annotations mask and it is equal to mask in "new_instance_should_be.npy"

    Scenario: Show object id
        Given Classes in file: "assets_split/annotations_show/classes_new.json" are uploaded to test Dataset
        And Dataset ontology has attributes "attr1" and "attr2"
        And Item in path "assets_split/annotations_show/0000000162.jpg" is uploaded to "Dataset"
        When Item is annotated with annotations in file: "assets_split/annotations_show/annotations_new.json"
        And Every annotation has an object id
        And I show items annotations with param "object_id"
        Then I receive annotations mask and it is equal to mask in "new_object_id_should_be.npy"

    Scenario: Finally
        Given Clean up
